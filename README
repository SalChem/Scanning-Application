Instructions:

Use cmake and point to source directory of CMakeLists.txt
and use Build folder as destination.

Add the following for configuration: +New Entry

VTK_DIR /Users/administrator/My Projects/VTK-bin

Also, as for now there is no prompt for images, so place the images called in the code under DEBUG in the Build folder.

ui_QTVTK_MSVEApplication.h is not included but will be created by QT after the first compilation.
